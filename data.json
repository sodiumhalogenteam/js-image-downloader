We charcoal mellow our whiskey drop by drop, then let it age in our own handcrafted barrels. And we don't follow a calendar. Our Tennessee Sippin' Whiskey is ready only when our tasters say it is. We use our senses, just like Jack Daniel himself did. In fact, more than a century later, our Tennessee Whiskey is still judged the same way. By the way it looks. By the way it smells. And, of course, by the way it tastes.",
